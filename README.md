Slackline-Buddy-Android-App
===========================

Final project for Mobile Application Development class (April 2014)


App Description 
===

Many new slackliners have trouble with proper upper body position. This app helps the user achieve good balance by 
providing a(n) (helpful/annoying) audible feedback system much like car's beeping back-up system.

RoapMap :
===

- The feedback system is currently based on the accelerometer. This should be changed to the gyroscope.
- A less annoying beeping feedback would be preferable
- General UI improvements
- Better paging for how-to flow
